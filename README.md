# Assignment 1 - Artificial Intelligence 

N-queens, Google-Maps-Search and modified 15 tile puzzle â€“ These projects were developed as a part of the class in Artificial Intelligence, where the aim was to implement searching techniques  - BFS, DFS, IDS, and A-Star (Technologies Used: Python) 

Problem 1 steps to run - 

1) Ensure that the input files - road_segments.txt and city_gps.txt are in the same folder as the problem1_solution.py program file.
2) Use the command line format - python problem1_solution.py [Bloomington,_Indiana] [Chenoa,_Illinois] [distance] [idfs]

Output Format -
The output shows the user first a detailed account of the journey, then on the next line - the time taken to run the program, then on the next line - the maximum fringe size for that algorithm and then on the last line the output of the program in the expected format as - 

[Total distance in miles: ] [Total time in hours: ] [Detailed Itinerary: ]
 
Time taken to run : 

Maximum fringe size:

[distance] [time] [start-city] [city1] [city2] ... [destination-city]


Problem 2 steps to run - 
1) Use the command line format - python solver15.py [input-file]

Problem 3 steps to run - 
1) Use the command line format - python wedding.py [input-file] [number of seats per table]
